Object Oriented Programming
  Way to write code to represent real life objects, concepts, things...
  Create object, think about what properties it should have
  Turtle might have shell, color, legs...

  Object literals - represent one things
  Object constructor - create many from the same thing

A method is a function of an object. A function is not always a method

Setting and getting properties of an object. Either "." or [name of property]
  More common now to use "." (Dot notation)
