### Class 7

Domain Modeling
  We didn't really talk about anything

UML Diagrams are a good way to map out objects

Object Oriented Programming
  Way to write code to represent real life objects, concepts, things...
  Create object, think about what properties it should have
  Turtle might have shell, color, legs...

  Object literals - represent one things
  Object constructor - create many from the same thing

A method is a function of an object. A function is not always a method

Setting and getting properties of an object. Either "." or [name of property]
  More common now to use "." (Dot notation)

echo "# git_demo" >> README.md      // >> adds to file, > overwrites what's in file already

HTML
  Use <code> for having stuff appear as 'code'

Ways to do text formatting
  px, em, rem
  em = 1 unit of font in base font size. browser default is 16px
  1em = 16px
  rem - whatever value is being inherited from parent


DOM Tree
  1. document node - is an object! we have been using it. all of the methods (createElement, geti, etc.) are part of the document node
  2. element nodes - tags we are writing in html (e.g., body, div, h1, etc.)
    3. attribute node - class, id, type, source, href, hidden
    4. text node - text




Constructor Functions



h1El.addEventListener('click', function () {console.log('helloworld')})



Box Model
  Content, padding, border, margin
